**Slayer's Beasts** adds a variety of real & fantasy mobs to the modded experience as well as over 20 new biomes to explore (with more yet to come). This mod aims to add a degree of challenge to the game with some harder mobs & bosses, while attempting to integrate these features seamlessly with the vanilla game. When this mod has reached a more complete stage, configs will be added and I may migrate some of the more worldgen-based features to a separate mod.
